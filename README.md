# OS-Project-1

RUNNING
1. In the directory of the makefile, run the command make to build the project.
2. In the same directory, run the command ./run_test.exe to run the project.

The script will run all test functions and dispaly which
functions ran successfully and which ones didnt.

PROBLEMS
1. Had some trouble with freeing memory. Realized that pointers can only be
freed if allocated with malloc otherwise will cause seg fault.
